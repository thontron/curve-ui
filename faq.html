            <h2>Curve FAQ</h2>
            <h3>What is Betavexity?</h3>

            <p>Betavexity relates specifically to the beta coefficient of a long tailed investment. The beta coefficient is a marker that indicates whether an investment is more or less volatile than the market as a whole, and betavexity helps to analyze the health of portfolios that have a similar nature to indices that feature financial instruments with shorter maturities â€“ meaning the financial instruments will end or need to be renewed after a relatively short period.
            <p>Certain investors such as insurance companies have longer term investment horizons than hedge funds which allow for investments in assets that have longer maturities. As a result, these investors can invest in assets that have an inherent return component linked to the dynamic of the term of the investment.
            </p></p>

              

            <p>              In this way, betavexity has similarities with bond convexity and gamma, which are analysis tools used with financial products such as options and bonds.</p></p>

            <h3>Has Curve been audited?</h3>
            <p>Curve smart contracts were <a href="https://www.curve.fi/audits/01-ToB.pdf">Audited</a> by
            Trail of Bits.</p>
            <p>However, security audits don't eliminate risks completely.
            Please donâ€™t supply your life savings, or assets you
            canâ€™t afford to lose, to Curve, especially as a liquidity
            provider.</p>

            <p>Using Curve as an exchange user should be significantly less
            risky, but this is not advice.</p>

            <h3>How do I trade on Curve?</h3>
            <p>Before trading, youâ€™ll have to approve Curve to interact with
            your DAI or USDC balance, similar to most DeFi applications.</p>

            <p>On the <a href="/">exchange</a>, select the asset you would like to convert (e.g.
            USDC), and the quantity (e.g. 1,000) - the exchange rate, and
            quantity that you will receive (including and all slippage and fees)
            will be displayed. The exchange rate might surprise you - thatâ€™s the
            power of Curve.</p>

            <h3>How do I provide liquidity to Curve?</h3>

            <p>Curve uses <a href="https://compound.finance/ctokens">cTokens</a>,
            assets inside the Compound protocol, as the
            liquidity pool - this ensures that assets are always being put to
            work. You can acquire cDAI or cUSDC by supplying DAI or USDC to
            <a href="https://app.compound.finance/">Compound</a>, or by
            acquiring cTokens on <a href="https://1inch.exchange/">1inch</a>, 
            <a href="https://paraswap.io/">Paraswap</a>, <a href="https://swap.totle.com/">Totle</a> or <a href="https://dex.ag/">Dex.ag</a>.</p>

            <p>Before providing liquidity, youâ€™ll have to approve Curve to
            interact with your cDAI or cUSDC balances.</p>

            <p>Visit the <a href="/deposit.html">Curve deposit page</a>, and your available balances should
            appear. If you <b>add all coins in a balanced proportion</b>, you will
            provide cTokens at the current exchange Curve rate; this requires
            you to have both assets in your wallet. You can uncheck this feature
            to supply one side of the market, or a different ratio of assets,
            and Curve will automatically exchange them into the proper quantity
            (with the same low slippage & fees of the Curve exchange) -
            magic!</p>

            <h3>What's "Use maximum amount of coins available"?</h3>
            <p>This means using all USDC and DAI in your wallet. This way is
            recommended only if you have much less coins than currently in
            liquidity pool.</p>

            <h3>What's "Infinite approval - trust this contract forever"?</h3>
            <p>This means that you preapprove the contract to to be able to spend any amount of your coins when you interact with it.
            This means that you won't be asked every time to appove the amount of coins you want to transfer to the contract.
            </p>

            <h3>How to withdraw liquidity I provided?</h3>
            <p>Go to <a href="/withdraw.html">the withdraw page</a>. If you want
            to withdraw some percentage of your liquidity (the preferred way),
            type that percentage in the top field.
            You can, however, withdraw in a form of individual coins (USDC,
            DAI), having the exchange happening for you, if you type amounts in
            lower fields. You'll get charged with the exchange fee in the latter
            case.</p>
